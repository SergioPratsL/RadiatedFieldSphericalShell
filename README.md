# RadiatedFieldSphericalShell
Test script to calculate the field caused in the surroundings by a spherical shell of charge uniformly accelerated

The aim of this script is to test the fields caused by an acelerated surface uniformly charged and under uniform acceleration and obtain the radiated fields inside and in the proximity of the charged surface.

Results show that the electromagnetic field is not zero inside the surface as it happens with the static field, also, the field does not have the same shape in the proximity of the sphere than far-away, being the electric field stronger than the magnetic field in the proximity and not equal, as it happens far away from the source.

For greater distances, the radiated field caused by an accelerated surface converges with the one caused by an accelerated point-charge.
